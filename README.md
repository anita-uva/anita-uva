The COVID vaccine became available during the first quarter of 2021.  As the vaccine was distributed, first to those with the highest risk, then to the oldest and successively younger individuals, the Household Pulse Survey captured the reasons for those not getting vaccinations.  The total number of unvaccinated people drops dramatically through the months of the study.  As the overall numbers drop, the reasons given for remaining unvaccinated start to shift.

The top 2 reasons never shift:  People were solidly concerned about side effects of this new vaccine, and generally felt better waiting to see how it affected others.  Notice also the reason "others need it first" falls, maybe expectedly, as the vaccine was released to higher risk and lower risk individuals over time.

The survey asked respondents to rate their feelings of Anxiety on a scale from 1 to 5.  This is the average response from January 2021 through July 2021.

 Notice, as the vaccination is distributed, people begin to feel less anxious, overall.  We also see people on edge during the time with notable reactions to destabilizing news.
